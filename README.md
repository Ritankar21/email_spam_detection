# email_spam_detection

In this project I have created a model which will be able to detect spam messages from emails or sms.
The model is mainly built on naive bayes(multinomial) algorithm.I have tried using other alogorithms as well but this one gave highest accuracy and precision.
I have also used nltk library for various reasons like tokenization,removing stopwords,special characters etc.
The model is hosted on streamlit and deployed on heroku and it is fully functional right now.
